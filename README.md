# SasView automated publications feed

Based off of ncnr_publications created by Brian Maranville.
More information is available on the [SasView wiki](https://github.com/SasView/sasview/wiki/DevNotes_Processes_PublicationsWebPageInstructions).

## Backend

Based on [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org)

- [sasview_publications](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2309096/sasview/items) group (private membership, public read)
- SasView members manage publication list
- Collection ID(s) for SasView list(s) is added to config.py for automatic sync with sasview pages (frontend)

### Recurring Github Action

- Every hour: Run /.github/workflows/pub_update.yml that pulls in all publications from Zotero using the Zotero api (https://api.zotero.org) and compares each citation to latest version published. Zotero entries and the publications website are update as needed.
